Hello! My program uses the imblearn library to balance the dataset which isn't included in the default Anaconda installation.

It can be installed via pip install -U imbalanced-learn

Also, during my hyper parameter tuning, I used GridSearch, which takes a long time to go through all combinations of parameters for my model.
I've commented out this block of code so you don't have to spend that time as I've already used those parameters in my model.

Thank you :)
